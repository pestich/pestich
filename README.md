## Hello, world! 🚀 

I'm Anatoliy Pestich, an aspiring programmer and a specialist in the fascinating field of NLP. I'm passionate about leveraging the power of technology to solve real-world problems, and NLP is my chosen path to make a meaningful impact.


## My Expertise

### Natural Language Processing

- **Named Entity Recognition**: Identifying entities such as names, dates, locations  and address components within text. I'm skilled in NER and have worked on projects that involve entity recognition. I'm impressed by the capabilities of the spaCy library, and I really enjoy using it, including for text preprocessing.

- **Text Classification**: I have experience in developing and fine-tuning machine learning models for text classification tasks. In my projects, I have worked with news articles and press releases from various organizations. I am passionate about the media industry and see significant potential for the integration of artificial intelligence technologies into it.

- **Text Clustering**: One of the key projects is the clustering of unlabeled textual data. For tackling such tasks, I prefer to apply the DBSCAN method and utilize the Plotly library, which enables the creation of interactive graphics. I am simply enthralled by the capabilities of Plotly!

### Programming Skills

- **Python**: My go-to programming language is Python. I'm proficient in Python and use it extensively for NLP projects and automation tasks.

- **Version Control**: I'm well-versed in using version control systems like Git to collaborate on projects and track changes.

- **Machine Learning Libraries**: I'm familiar with popular machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and spaCy.
